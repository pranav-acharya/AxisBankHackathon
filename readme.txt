The auto dealers data is based on two cities, Delhi and Bangalore, and is being crawled from justdial.com

Part 1:
The links for each city are generated by the script as given below:

var a = $(".jcn a"); // all the hyperlinks
var links = "";
for(var i=0;i<a.length;i++){ links += a[i] +"\n"; }

The output from this file is saved as a csv file and then the links are crawled using the script autoDealers.py

Part 2:
autoDealers.py scrapes the data from the justDial database, and also queries alexa.com to get the alexa score for that particular website (if it exists for that particular dealer). If it doesn't exist, it gets the default scores

Below is the mapping of the features which gives an overview of how the required features are achieved which would be used to model the trustworthyness of the dealer and give him a rank.
(In order, as found in the CSV)

dealer_name 
total_rating & total_votes,(Rating as per justDial which will serve as a measure of the quality of service/website) 
year_established ( How well is it established, hence depicting the sales )

Below factors measure the Quality of the website and the no. of views and the time spent on the website. These factors were chosen based on the availability of the data. Various websites/services crawl periodically to find out the visits and alexa is one of them.
alexaRank - rank given by alexa (by amazon). Lower the value, implies better the website
pageViewsPerVisitor - No. of views of pages per visitor
dailyTimeOnSiteInSeconds - average time spent on the website.
websiteURL - denoting whether it has its own website, if its "none" then the website doesn't exist


Execution:
to run the autoDealers.py script, you need all the links from justDial to be crawled in a csv file which was explained in Part 1.
The output of autoDealers.py will generate a csv file which will have all the features.

The Sample output can be found as 
delhi_output.csv (for input as delhi_dealers_justdial_links.csv)
bangalore_output.csv (for input as bangalore_dealers_justdial_links.csv)
